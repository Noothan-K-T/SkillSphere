### Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the **+** icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `skillsphere-ai-platform`).
4.  Choose whether you want it to be **Public** or **Private**.
5.  **Do not** initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license. We've already created our own.
6.  Click **"Create repository"**.

### Step 3: Upload Your Code Using Terminal Commands

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with some commands. We'll use those now. Run these commands one by one from your main `Skillsphere` folder in your terminal.

1.  **Initialize Git in your project:**
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    ```

2.  **Add all your files to be tracked (Git will automatically use the `.gitignore` file):**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Save your changes with a commit message:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Full-stack SkillSphere application with AI features"
    ```

4.  **Connect your local project to your new GitHub repository:**
    * Go to your new repository's page on GitHub and copy the URL it provides. It will look like `https://github.com/YourUsername/skillsphere-ai-platform.git`.
    * Run this command, replacing the URL with your own:
        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/skillsphere-ai-platform.git
        ```

5.  **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
