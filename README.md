(Note: You can take a screenshot of your beautiful Aurora UI and upload it somewhere like Imgur to replace this link!)

SkillSphere is a full-stack web application that acts as a personal AI career coach. It analyzes a user's current skills and generates a personalized, step-by-step roadmap to help them achieve their future career goals.

This project was built from the ground up, integrating a modern frontend, a powerful backend API, multiple databases, and cutting-edge AI models to provide real, actionable career advice.

âœ¨ Key Features
Secure User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and have their sessions securely managed using JWT tokens.

AI-Powered Resume Parser: Leverages Google's Gemini AI to intelligently parse resume text, extracting and categorizing skills, work experience, and education.

Dynamic & Personalized Career Roadmaps:

Users input their current role and desired future role.

The application sends this, along with the user's current skills from their resume, to the AI.

The AI generates a unique, step-by-step learning plan that focuses on filling the user's specific skill gaps.

Save & View Roadmaps: Users can permanently save their generated roadmaps to their account and view them at any time.

Beautiful & Modern UI: A stunning, fully responsive "Aurora" dark-mode interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth animations and a vibrant, engaging color palette.
